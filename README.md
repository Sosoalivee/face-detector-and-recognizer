# ðŸ‘¤ Face Detection & Recognition System using OpenCV (FisherFaces)

This project implements a full face recognition pipeline using OpenCV. It collects face images, trains a recognition model using the **FisherFaceRecognizer**, and recognizes faces in real time from a webcam feed.

## ðŸ“¸ Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- Dataset creation and automatic labeling
- Model training using FisherFaceRecognizer
- Real-time recognition with name and confidence display
- Logs unknown faces and saves image if unidentified for long
