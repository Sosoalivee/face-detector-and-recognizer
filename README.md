# ðŸ“¸ Face Dataset Collection with OpenCV

This project captures 100 grayscale face images of a person using Haar Cascade face detection and stores them in a labeled directory structure. It's designed as a data collection step for building a face recognition system.

## ðŸ§  What It Does

- Detects faces in real-time from a webcam using Haar Cascades.
- Captures and saves 100 face samples resized to a standard shape (130x100).
- Saves images in a dataset folder under the specified person's name.
